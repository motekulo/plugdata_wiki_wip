## Ableton Live

#### MIDI IN

#### MIDI OUT

In Live, routing MIDI data out of **plugdata** is a bit more complicated than in other DAWs.

1. Create a MIDI track with the VST3 (not AUV3) version of **plugdata** on it *(a)*.
2. Create an empty MIDI track. We'll call it **MIDI BRIDGE** *(b)*. In the **MIDI From** drop-down menu, select the **plugdata** MIDI track *(c)*. Select **plugdata** in the drop-down menu right bellow it. Switch **Monitor** to **In** mode (d). 
3. Create a third MIDI track. We'll cal it RECEIVER *(e)*. Load an instrument that you want to receive MIDI from **plugdata** on this track.
4. In the **MIDI To** drop-down menu of the **MIDI BRIDGE** track, select the **RECEIVER** track as the destination *(f)*.
5. *(optional)* In the **MIDI From** drop-down menu of the RECEIVER track select the **MIDI BRIDGE** track *(g)*.
6. Arm the RECEIVER track *(h)*. 
7. In **plugdata** plugin, use one of the objects that sends out MIDI data *(see examples)*.
